This branch builds against **esp_idf_version = master**

This is a small project to show and reproduce a problem that occurs when compiling the boilerplate code generated by 
the `esp-rs/esp-idf-template`

To reproduce:

`cargo generate esp-rs/esp-idf-template cargo`

project name `prob-idf`, MCU target `esp32c3` **esp_idf_version = master**

```
cd prob-idf
cargo build |& tee cargo_build.log
```

The build logs and resulting error is visible in [cargo_build.log](cargo_build.log)


There are two other branches with version ESP_IDF_VERSION=5.2.1  and ESP_IDF_VERSION=master, respectively.
